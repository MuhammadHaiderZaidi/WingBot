# pyCoach
What does pyCoach do, you ask? Whenever the program terminates due to an error it automatically fecthes releveant solutions from Google primarly from Stackoverflows and displays it along the usual error message so you dont have to open a new tab and search for the solution yourself each time you get stuck.
This could be genereally helpful for those are new to python.

This program is a very basic version of what i'm trying to make and im looking forward to improving the results in future

- [x] Just install the package using the "pip" command and activate it using the function, and  the package is ready to guide you through out your coding
